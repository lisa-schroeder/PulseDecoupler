Master thesis of Lisa Schr√∂der

Institute for Biological Interfaces 4 (IBG-4)

## Applications

Simulation of homonuclear and heteronuclear decoupling sequences with respect to variuos parameters such as coupling constant, B1-inhomogeneity, linewidth,...

Introduction of figure of merit p to describe the J dependency of the maximum and sideband intensity

## Instruction

Type of simulation needs to be defined in the input file

All parameters are defined in the input file

run.jl needs to be exectued in order to run the simulations
