# Pulse Decoupler

Master thesis of Lisa Schr√∂der

Karlsruhe Institute of Technology

Institute for Biological Interfaces 4 (IBG-4)

## Applications

Simulation of homonuclear and heteronuclear decoupling sequences with respect to variuos parameters such as coupling constant, B1-inhomogeneity, linewidth,...

Introduction of figure of merit p to describe the J dependency of the maximum and sideband intensity

## Instructions

An exemplary input file is given (params.txt)

Type of simulation and all parameters need to be defined in the input file

run.jl needs to be exectued in order to run the simulations

Detailed instructions can be found in the appendix of the Master's Thesis
